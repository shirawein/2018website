		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color = #3D3DA1 size = "5">T</font>he Gale-Shapley algorithm, also called the stable marriage problem or deferred acceptance algorithm, ensures the best matching between two sets of agents such that all individuals are best paired in a freely trading system. These agents could be people, companies or organizations, and all of these groups and individuals elect into the system. The algorithm, which ensured that free pairs be efficiently matched, was originally developed by American economists David Gale and Lloyd Shapley in the 1960s ("Stable Matching”). Economist and game theorist Alvin Roth then extended their work to use it for practical applications. For their cumulative work, Shapley and Roth earned the 2012 Nobel Prize for Economics (“Alvin E. Roth”).     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computers shaped the function of the National Science Foundation because the NSF was specifically created to further the sciences, including scientific progress. One of the goals of the NSF is to promote scientific progress, which is accomplished through research, the creation of scientific and engineering programs, education programs for all levels of science and engineering, and dispersal of information for policy formulation ("National Science Foundation.”) Upon the exploration of supercomputer centers and networks, the NSF devoted resources to computer science and technological advancement. <br> 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gale-Shapley algorithm influences societal use of data by building stable matchings, such as matching students to schools. The Gale-Shapley algorithm also led to the development of an algorithm that matches transplant recipients to donors in the United Kingdom, called the Kidney Exchange Matching Algorithm. The Gale-Shapley algorithm also changed societal interaction with data in that it digitized human categorical preferences, and therefore produced a quantifiable source for best fulfilling the preferences of two separate groups simultaneously. The marked social influence of this algorithm is that the matching services that utilize the algorithm make the pairing less arbitrary or random, so that the agents would have the best option possible and thus would be less likely to leave the agent with whom they are matched.
		<br> <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This algorithm can be illustrated in hypothetical use for matching spouses. The algorithm leads to a stable matching, because no agent can break up and form a match that would make them better off. Each agent already is already matched with their most preferred agent that will accept them. The proposing group makes an offer to the agent they most prefer, and then the receiving group retains the most attractive proposal and rejects the rest. This continues until no proposing agent wants to make any more proposals and each receiving agent accepts the proposal they hold. The setup of the algorithm causes the proposing agents to find the best ￼outcomes ("Stable Matching”). Simply, each member of the proposing group orders the receiving group by preference and vice versa (“The Stable Marriage Problem and School Choice”). Then, the proposing group recursively proposes to their most preferred member of the receiving group and the receiving group recursively holds the offer from their most preferred proposing agent.
		<br> <br> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin Roth modified the Gale-Shapley algorithm to match medical school graduates with hospitals (“Alvin E. Roth”). American medical school graduates are typically employed as residents in hospitals. In the 1940s, medical schools had such trouble finding medical school graduates, because medical school graduates were a scarce resource, that they started offering residencies before students graduated. The students therefore were not able to demonstrate their qualifications and did not yet know which branch of medicine they wanted to go into. For the hospital, if their offer was rejected it was too late to find other graduates. Therefore, hospitals started forcing response deadlines which caused students to not have a full scope of their opportunities. Out of this system, few stable matches were made. The new algorithm, closely related to the Gale-Shapley algorithm, provided- a stable matching for medical school students and hospitals (“Stable Matching").
		<br> <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new applicant-proposing algorithm is put to use by a centralized clearinghouse called the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), which is a private, non-profit organization established in 1952. The NRMP matches 41,000 residency applicants yearly as well as for 60 subspecialties for Fellowship matches. The NRMP matched 42,370 registered applicants to 30,750 positions at over 4,800 residency programs across the United States in 2016, which was the largest on record. The Residency Match is now the accepted system by which medical school students attain residency positions in training programs across the United States. For unmatched applicants, there is a Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program designed to match unfilled residency positions with applicants. In 2016, 1,097 of the 1,178 unfilled residency positions were matched during the Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program ("Results of 2016 NRMP Main Residency Match”). Therefore, hospitals are matched with their best potential hires and the medical school graduates are paired with the employer that best suits their needs. The algorithm utilized by the National Resident Matching Program allows medical school ￼students to take inventory of the opportunities that best match their career needs as well as best fill the positions at hospitals, which fosters satisfaction for both Residents and hospitals.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This medical school algorithm was then expanded to match students with New York City high schools by Roth’s team (“Alvin E. Roth”). Each year, about 75,000 New York city students apply and interview for spots in 426 public high schools (Tullis). Before implementing a stable matching algorithm, New York city eighth graders applied for admission into a public high school by listing their five most preferred high schools. The high schools then decided to accept, waitlist, or reject each applicant. However, lower-performing students would often not be accepted into any schools, and would then have to wait to hear about acceptance into a school that was not on their list of five preferences. Schools would then also underrepresent capacity so that they could leave room for students who did not list that high school as a highly preferred choice. Therefore, all students were forced to strategically misrepresent their preferences and it was difficult to build a stable match. Alvin Roth, along with economists Atila Abdulkadiroglu and Parag Pathak, developed an algorithm to match high schools with students, resulting in more high school students receiving offers from their first-choice school (“The Stable Marriage Problem and School Choice”).
		<br> <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This algorithm, called the “deferred acceptance” algorithm provides all players with their optimized result. Now, instead of encouraging students to make safe choices in building a school wish list, students would be most benefitted by accurately representing their preferences. When the “deferred acceptance” algorithm was first implemented in 2004, the number of unmatched students fell from 31,000 to 3,000. Roughly half of the matched students are assigned to their first-choice school, and the algorithm matches low and high-achieving students about the same rate to their first-choice schools (Tullis). The matches out of this algorithm are based on stability, meaning that there is no student and school pair that would prefer to be matched over their current matching (“The Stable Marriage Problem and School Choice”). By using this algorithm to match students to schools, all agents contribute in building the best learning environment possible.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in 2003, Roth developed the Kidney Exchange Matching algorithm to match kidney donors with recipients (“Alvin E. Roth”). The top trading cycle algorithm implemented ￼works by initially allocating the object, kidneys in the case of the Kidney Exchange Matching algorithm, and swapping the objects afterwards. In this matching algorithm, some donors and recipients cannot be matched because the organ is not compatible. Therefore, this algorithm requires complex multilateral donation chains. The Kidney Exchange Matching algorithm has now been adopted in the U.K. and multiple states in the U.S. ("Stable Matching: Theory, Evidence, and Practical Design”).
		<br> <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this set of multilateral donation chains, kidney recipients with loved ones willing to donate but are not a biological match, swap kidneys with a pair in the same situation. This, however, happens on many levels so that the match does not have to be a one-for-one direct swap (Ryssdal and Dubner). Involving a non directed donor, who has not been paired with a patient but is still willing to donate a kidney, the kidney exchanges do not have to be simultaneous and therefore long chains of organ exchanges become possible. More than 100,000 people are waiting for a kidney in the United States (Shute). Roth’s algorithm is now used in the United States to match about 600 kidney donors with recipients per year, while in 2000, before the algorithm was implemented, only 2 kidney transplants were paired in total (Ryssdal and Dubner). In order to save lives of kidney recipients, the resources must be well organized, such that exchanges are made to best ensure those in need of a transplant receive their best match. The Kidney Exchange Matching algorithm allows for resources to be allocated beyond a single hospital’s database. Expanding resources therefore allows for inter-hospital organ matching, which more quickly connects those in need of an organ with those willing to donate.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gale-Shapley algorithm had a social influence in the way society interacts with data, in that it makes people the data and provides all clients with the best possible outcome. The algorithm provides a better match for both sets of agents. While the algorithm is only used for stable marriages hypothetically, adaptations of the Gale-Shapley algorithm directly successfully match employees within a field such as medical school graduates with hospitals, students in New York with the school that will best suit the educational needs of the student, and an organ matching algorithm to pair kidney donors with recipients.
