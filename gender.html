		<br> I. INTRODUCTION <br> <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color = #3D3DA1 size = "7">U</font>sing a consequentialist ethical system, the effect of computer interaction on gender equality can be evaluated. Furthermore, the role of access to technology on gender equity and the outcomes of technological progress can be assessed through the same lens. Consequentially, excluding women from technology is worse for the international market and for the communities and families in which those women live. The lack of Internet access, combined with the lack of resources to utilize communication and information technologies, further marginalizes women. Even when given access, girls are conditioned to form a negative perception of technology. The issue bears on the current underrepresentation of women in technology, which is furthered by the marketing of technology towards men and discouraging women from entering into technological fields via social conditioning. On the other hand, agricultural advancements and the globalization of developing countries have brought new job opportunities to women in developing countries, broadening opportunities within workforce for women. Computers have also positively impacted women, primarily through access to information technology, though the current implementation of technology do not foster gender equality. Therefore, technological progress has had a negative impact on gender equality because it fails to include women in the process of technological progress. <br>
		<br> II. WOMEN’S LACK OF ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY <br> <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women have less access to technology, which decreases their interaction with technology and makes them less likely to work in computing. In 2013, 200 million more men had Internet access than women. In many parts of the world, women are 21% less likely to own a mobile phone than men (“How does access to technology...”). However, women in developing countries sare less turned off by the environment of computing fields by women in the United States. In a number of developing countries, women comprise between 30 and 50 percent of student in computer science and other natural sciences. African women have the lowest participation rates in the world in education in technological fields at all levels of education. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than one percent of people in developing countries have Internet access. The women in developing countries with Internet access are more representative of the educated elite than of all the women in the country. Women are 22% of all Internet users in Asia, 38% of Internet users in Latin America, and 6% of all Internet users in the Middle East. Women’s access to information technology depends on level of education, language, free time, geographic location, and social and cultural standing. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women’s access to Information technology depends on more than a connected computer, but rather the level of education, economic stability, culture, and geographical location (Hafkin and Taggart). Women have less access to the resources required in order to engage with technology, such as education and finances (Elan). Though some of the barriers to entry within the digital divide seem to be shared by men and women, such as the weak communications infrastructure in developing countries, the problems are still more difficult for women to overcome because of they are already marginalized. More women than men live in rural areas within developing countries and women are the poorest within poor households. Women therefore have less access to what exists of a communications infrastructure due to location and aren’t as freely able to use money. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barriers to entry within the digital divide that include gender as a clear facet include literacy and education, which is limited for women in developing countries, and continues to be true when specifically considering technical educations. Women are also required to dedicate more time to the household and have less access to technologically-enabled facilities (Hafkin and Taggart). <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to technology is critical for women in developing countries because it increases economic empowerment via connectivity. Connectivity-based economic empowerment provides women more independence and security, and benefits the whole community because women invest 90% of their earnings into their family and community. 75% of women in developing countries using the Internet use the Internet to self-educate, furthering benefiting the community in addition to themselves. Increasing connectivity in developing countries could lead to a $21 return on investment per dollar spent (Contes). <br>
		<br> III. GIVEN ACCESS, GIRLS’ RELATIONSHIP WITH TECHNOLOGY <br> <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a study performed by Lal, women had a much more negative perception of computer technology and were more inclined to use traditional methods, which research suggested was due to socialization rather than inherent gender differences. As quoted in Lal, Spender demonstrates that the female withdrawal from computer technology is mostly due to socialization, because girls are taught from a young age to avoid taking risks. Boys, on the other hand, are socially taught to start on tasks without planning it out. Therefore, when first accessing something new on a computer, boys are faster users because they immediately familiarize themselves with the interface, while girls search out how the technology works before employing it. Lal cites a paper from 2000 by Karen Kelly, who argues that girls are averse to computer science because it lacks teamwork and social interaction, rather than that they believe they are not good at computer science. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also found that on a male-stereotyped computer task, boys performed better than girls, but that there was no difference in performance by gender when the computer task was gender neutral (Lal). Technology reflects the people who make it, and most technology is currently designed by men (“How does access to technology...”). While women have above 50 percent participation in the life sciences in some countries, the female participation rate in physics, computer science, and engineering is less than 30 percent in most countries (Elan). Within Lal’s study, Kelly also addresses that most games are designed by males and as such are targeted towards male audiences, featuring themes such as violence and first-person action. Because the games are targeted towards boys, boys then spend more time with computers than girls, better acquainting boys with the technology and therefore furthering the cycle of more men joining computing (Lal). <br>
		<br> IV. TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS ON WOMEN’S EMPLOYMENT <br> <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technological progress provides employment opportunities to women by outsourcing and sub-contracting. In rural developing countries, employment for female agricultural workers has increased due to the creation of high-yielding grain and crop varieties. In industries such as publishing, fashion, and technology bring women into the workforce through technological outsourcing. Manufacturing automation, however, simultaneously serves as a threat of unemployment to women (“Effects of technological change”). Increases in levels of female employment, but not of male employment, between the years of 1995 and 2005 correlated to increases in international trade. Globalization, which includes economic integration and dispersion of technology, has created more jobs and increased market connectivity for women, which increases their economic opportunity. When combined with public policy, globalization can lead to an increase in gender equality (“World Development Report 2012”). For example, Congo’s recent policies for the advancement of women include rights to access of media and information technologies (“Women’s access to information technologies...”).
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New technologies change the workforce makeup by skill, due to increasing skill polarization. Men are much more likely to be specially technically-skilled, while women are more likely to be technically semi-skilled or have jobs that require minimal training (“Effects of technological change”). Economic integration due to globalization has benefitted skilled workers but not unskilled workers (“World Development Report 2012”). In order for women to work in information technology at the level of a computer programmer, education is required, which is made difficult by the global low enrollment of women in science education (Hafkin and Taggart).
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the little training required, employers are able to hire temporary workers rather than employ women for a full-time job. This gives women job and income insecurity. Due to the progressing trend of automating lower-skilled work and increased demand for highly-skilled work, women are more likely to become out of work as they are more concentrated in lower- skilled work. Since technological progress brings about change in level of skill required, causing women to be replaced by men. This is also affected by the “deskilling” of women, as their labor- based skills become less important due to progress in production technologies. In 1994, 30,000 factory workers, who were mainly women, became unemployed in Thailand due to technological unemployment.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technological progress in the form of mechanization in agriculture also displaces more female than male laborers. Though high-yielding grain and crop in rural developing countries also leads to employment for female agricultural laborers because of the increase in demand, mechanization decreases women’s participation in agricultural production. In Indonesia, the introduction of new technology within labor-intensive agriculture, typically performed by women, labor hours per hectare has been reduced from 1,469 to 625 per year. Therefore, technological progress in agriculture moves economic control from women to men.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technological progress provides female workers the benefit of globalization, while also depriving them of physical labor work. Globalization has led to the generation of jobs in data collection and secretarial work as well as to the creation of data processing centers in Caribbean nations, India, Singapore, the Philippines and China. These new jobs have led to new employment for women, almost exclusively, but still provide minimal opportunity for advancement. Technological developments also remove women’s advantages within the market for cheap physical labor, and this increase in skill requirement accounts for falling proportions of women in the workforce (“Effects of technological change”).
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1990, communication technology has increased and changed the employment gender distribution across sectors. Women have moved out of agriculture and into manufacturing and services. In developing countries, women working in manufacturing and the service industry as a proportion of global female employment increased from 6 percent in manufacturing and 17 percent in service in 1987 to 7 percent in manufacturing and 24 percent in service in 2007. In developed countries, however, where increased mechanization within manufacturing is most prominent, the percent of women working in manufacturing of global female employment fell from 12 percent in 1987 to 6 percent in 2007. At the same time, the share of women employed in service increased from 44 percent in 1987 to 46 percent in 2007 in developed countries (“World Development Report 2012”).
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ways to help women adjust to new technologies include firm policies assuring economic and social objectives, skill training, bettering and expanding the labor market for information systems, and assurances for those unemployed due to technological progress (“Effects of technological change”).
		
		<br>  <br> V. BENEFITS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR WOMEN <br> 

		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without technology, women depend on traditional sources of information and employment, particularly upon their patriarchs. Through information technology, women are able to globalize, network, and strategize as a community. While women continue to be concentrated in lower-skilled jobs in technological services and have small percentages of managerial and software positions, information technology provides opportunities to female entrepreneurs. For example, entrepreneurs require technology to market their business and school-age girls can use computers to learn. Information technology can be incorporate into businesses, providing more economic independence. As modeled by the Grameen Phone in Bangladesh, communications boutiques in Senegal and Morocco, and phone shops in Ghana, IT-enabled phone businesses are a new way for women entrepreneurs to find economic stability and take advantage of the communications market (Hafkin and Taggart).
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lack of access to resources, combined with illiteracy, removes access to information and communication technology from women. Without providing women access to these technologies, the nation in which those women reside is not able to compete in the global market (“Women’s access to information technologies...”).
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information technology provides a drastic step for countries and regions to develop socially, economically, and politically, and this inclusion versus exclusion of information technology causes what is called the digital divide. Women in developing countries are the most affected by the digital divide and are more affected than men at the same level of poverty. As information technology is directly associated with economic and social status, it is imperative that women in developing countries access and use new technologies, or risk further marginalization. The most successful information technology must provide basic needs as well as aid women out of marginalization (Hafkin and Taggart).
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased access to information provides citizens of developing countries the opportunity to learn about other regions, which can promote discussion of egalitarianism. Increased women’s economic empowerment enforces this discussion and adaptation of egalitarianism by questioning gender roles and giving women the opportunity to voice their opinions, within the household and outside (World Development Report). Access to information technology and media is closely linked with respect for human rights and decreases the levels of violence against women (“Women’s access to information technologies...”).
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information technology allows women to be involved in government, especially women in developing countries. Information technology provides political power to women, such that they can work as their own political advocates and network to build a presence of women within the political process. By involving women in the political process, more women become elected officials and women are more aware of their governmental rights and services available to them (Hafkin and Taggart). Chile’s web portal, Mujerschile.cl, provides information of health, law with emphasis on family law, and other cultural miscellanea.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women’s access to media and information technologies expands access to opportunities for advancement and education, leading to economic empowerment. By involving women in these technologies, they are able to shape gender-impacted policies and programs as well as minimize gender divides (“Women’s access to information technologies...”).
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key step in increasing women’s access to information technology lies in providing women in underserved areas access to communication. This can be achieved by providing communication services to places publicly available and accessible to women, such as common use facilities, including telecenters and phone shops.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information technology empowers women by allowing them to network, giving them access to political resources, involving women more in the political process and electing more female officials as a result, improving women’s access to governmental resources, giving women the tools to self-educate, and increasing general knowledge. Providing women in developing countries access to technology also allows them to delve into the world of e-commerce, which is very profitable and does not require any education. Women can use information technologies to network, campaign politically, and share information (Hafkin and Taggart).
		
		<br> <br> VI. CONCLUSION <br>
		
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology companies led by women have a 21% greater return on investment than technology companies led by men. If 600 million more women and girls had Internet access, that would boost the US GDP (Gross Domestic Product) by 18 billion (“How does access to technology...”).
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technological progress, given the inclusion for women, is beneficial for all, women and others. However, current technological progress fails to include women in the process, so women are being isolated from the cycle of development and face further marginalization. Subscribing to a consequentialist ethical system, providing women with more access to technology and involving them in the process of technological development increases women’s independence and betters the workforce in its entirety. Women should be empowered through technology by providing access to knowledge about computing and information technology.
